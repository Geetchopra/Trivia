# Trivia Magic

This is a project me and my team made for a course at the University of Toronto. This trivia app has a lot of cool features including saving your scores, adding your own questions and many more! Check them out at -

Note:
	Please install the node modules first before running this code on your local machine. You can do so by completing the following steps on the command line in your main directory -

		npm init -y
		npm install --save
		npm start

Hope you liked the app!
